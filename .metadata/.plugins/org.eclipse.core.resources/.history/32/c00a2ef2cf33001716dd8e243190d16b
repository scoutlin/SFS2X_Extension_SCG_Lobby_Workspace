/**

 * @author UX303
 *The event is fired when the HRC (highly resilient connection) feature is turned on and a 
 *User is trying to reconnect.
When a User looses connection for an unknown reason the client will attempt to re-connect 
immediately. If the operation is done within the expected time the User connection will be 
resumed transparently. The User does not loose its current state and it's not removed from 
the server so, for example, the game can continue from the point it was stopped (if turn-based).

This event notifies the developer that the User is in "reconnection mode". 
The event can be used to stop the game if necessary or simply notify the other player of 
the temporary change. The reconnection time is specified in the Zone configuration using 
the

setting.
Level: Zone, Room

Parameters:

SFSEventParam.ZONE: the Zone ( Zone )
SFSEventParam.USER: the User ( User )
